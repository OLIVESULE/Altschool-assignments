    <h3>reason why i joined ALT school africa</h3>
    <p> when i showed  interest in learning tech my friend introduced me to ALT school african,
         i was skeptical about it at first because it is an oline school, 
        i felt like i was going to be scammed, it been two month into the school and i am so happy i made the right desision.<br>
        The teaching and learning structure is very organized. <br>
        The school offers a very flexible learning schedule, which give me the opportunity  to balance learning with my daily
         activity without stress and also making available learning materials available .
       i really want to make the most of this opportunity given to me by ALT school to become a great programmer.
       build app that will help  people daily living.
